Inspired by the visual language of the Timeline found on the Pebble Time, TimeStyle shows you what's happening now: the time, the date, and the current weather conditions!

* Unlike most Pebble faces, the time text is displayed using antialiasing, achieved using automatic palette swapping.
* Configurable: includes over 20 preset color schemes, and also supports custom colors using any color the Pebble Time can display.
* Supports saving, loading, and sharing custom presets
* Optional battery life indicator, with optional percentage
* Sidebar can be displayed on the right or left side
* Selectable temperature units
* Bluetooth disconnection icon on disconnect, with optional vibration
* Displays dates in 21 different languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Czech, Slovak, Portuguese, Greek, Swedish, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Catalan, Norwegian, Russian, Estonian, Basque, Finnish and  Lithuanian.
* Weather can be disabled entirely
* Optional alternate font, LECO
