Inspired by the visual language of the Timeline found on the Pebble Time, TimeStyle shows you what's happening now: the time, the date, and the current weather conditions!

* Unlike most Pebble faces, the time text is displayed using antialiasing, achieved using automatic palette swapping.
* Configurable: includes over 20 preset color schemes, and also supports custom colors using any color the Pebble Time can display.
* Sidebar can be displayed on the right or left side
* Selectable temperature units
* Bluetooth disconnection icon on disconnect
* Displays dates in 5 different languages: English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian
